<!-- #Part 1: Fedup the weekend hack

###The Problem
It's crazy that in the 21st century law enforcement/legal system still rely heavily on foggy testimony and paper police reports.

Not only is there a lack of forensic audio, gps, and timestamped information, but what little there may be is closely guarded by the police.

So we made a way for users to directly document, review and share evidence without having to go through anyone else.



###Design Considerations and My role as the designer
When conceiving our idea, we were reallly reluctant to make another app for the already cluttered appstore. My priority was to ensure our app was accesible and unobtrusive as possible when running in the background. After all, our product offers no value if it isn't used in crucial moments. Our theme is empowering people, so visually, the goal was to make the android app look like a badge worn by an officer. (include inspirational pictures here). At the same time, we wanted to protect our users and make sure they could use our app while keeping it in their pocket. For this reason, we made the tough decision to go with audio recording instead of video recording. This would also make our app more useful in situations with poor lighting conditions, hence the decision to go with the darker interface.

. 

###The Badge 
On a practical level It's hard to present and demo an app designed to run in the background so we gave it some visuals. On a conceptual level, our mission was to empower citizens so we signified this visually by creating our own badge.

It looks a little stale, but having a closer look you can see it's inspired by federal emblems and police badges.

Aside from the flashy badge, we kept the style dark and lowkey. A key difference between FedUp and other apps is that we designed it around collecting audio rather than video recordering because it's more lowkey and useful in poor lighting conditions. At the same time we wanted our badge to be easily recognizable as a symbol for empowerment.

In hindsight, there are many things I would have done differently for our pebble Fedup app. There’s too much going on plus it doesn’t fully utilize pebble’s vertical screen orientation.


Here’s a visual process for a mobile justice project I did at Hack the North. We won the dropbox api prize, and decided to continue this project by partnering with the ACLU of Missouri and national office. A major reworking of the justice system is currently in the pipeline.
